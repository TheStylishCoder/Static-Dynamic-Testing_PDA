### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

#There should be a colon after else
#There should be two equals signs ==. One is assigning a value to a variable not checking if something is equal.
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
#dif should be def
#There should be a comma between card1 and card2
#Everything should be indented by a space

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

#Cards isn't referenced so create a list called cards. 
#total = 0 to begin
#The return statement should not be in the for loop. It should be inline with for.
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
